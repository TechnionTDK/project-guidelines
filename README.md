# TD&K Project Guidelines
This repository cotains guidelines for students taking projects in our lab. Following is a summary, with pointers to more detailed wiki pages.

## Exploration phase
A typical project starts with an Exploration phase. During that phase, that will last approximately 1-2 weeks, you will mostly experience with technologies that will be used in the project. Often, you will also have to explore and choose between different alternatives of the technology to be used. Most likely, we will create for you the issues to be tackled during that phase.

## Development Sprints
The rest of the project is divided into development cycles called "Sprints". In each Sprint you will implement an increment of functionality of the final product. During a Sprint, you are expected to strictly follow our [coding guidelines](https://github.com/TechnionTDK/project-guidelines/wiki/CodingGuidelines).

## Closing the project
In the end of the project, you will package all deliverables, and present your project as explained in [final presentation guidelines](https://github.com/TechnionTDK/project-guidelines/wiki/FinalPresentation).
